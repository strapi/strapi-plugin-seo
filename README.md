# Strapi plugin SEO

The official plugin to make your Strapi content SEO friendly

## Features

- Easily see which Content-Types does have the SEO component or not.
- Manage the important tags for your SEO (metatitle, metadescription) and preview your content in the SERP
- Manage your meta social tags (Facebook & Twitter) and preview your post.
- Strong SEO analysis for your content.

## Installation

To install this plugin, you need to add an NPM dependency to your Strapi application.

```sh
# Using Yarn
yarn add @strapi/plugin-seo

# Or using PNPM
pnpm add @strapi/plugin-seo

# Or using NPM
npm install @strapi/plugin-seo
```

## How it works

When clicking on the plugin homepage for the first time, the plugin will automatically look if a `shared.seo` component exists in your project. If not, the plugin will automatically create it with a sub `shared.meta-social` component.

If a `shared.seo` component already exists in your project. You might want to rename it or delete it otherwise, the plugin will not create the necessary component in order to work.

#### Homepage

From there you can get an overview of which content-types contains the SEO component or not. You can quickly add the SEO component to a selected content-type.

**Note**: By doing this, you will be redirected to the Content-Types builder on the specific content-type. You'll need to create a new component at the **root** of this content-type called `seo` using the existing component the plugin created for you: `shared.seo`.

#### Content Manager

From any content manager view for a content-type that contains the SEO component, you'll be able to see a right-side card dedicated for the SEO plugin. From there you can see a quick SEO analysis and action for you to perform (opening preview, opening complete analysis details modal).

**Note**: You'll need to fill your SEO component with data to be able to see the SERP preview, Social post preview and complete analysis.


## Configuration

`./config/plugins.ts`

```ts
export default () => ({
  // ...
  seo: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  // ...
});
```

Then, you'll need to build your admin panel:

```sh
# Using Yarn
yarn build

# Or using PNPM
pnpm build

# Or using NPM
npm run build
```

## SEO settings page

You'll be able from the SEO settings page to import a `shared.seo` & `shared.meta-social` components from any GitHub repository By default, our [components GitHub repository](https://github.com/strapi/components) is being used.

**Notice**: If you decide to import your own components, make sure that they belong to a `shared` category that their names is the same (`seo`, `meta-social`).
**Notice2**: When adding your SEO component, make sure to name it 'seo' and to include it in the root of your Content-Type.

## EditView SEO button

Once you create your SEO component in the edit view inside the Content Manager, the SEO button will appear on the the [right-links injection zone](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.html#injection-zones-api). You'll be able to:

- Manage the meta title & description of your content and preview it in SERP.
- Manage your meta social tags (Facebook & Twitter) and preview your post.
- Analyze your content a little deeper via an SEO analysis of your content.

## LLMS.txt

Since version 2.0.9, a new LLMS field is available on the main page of the plugin. This field has been added for you to manage the content of your llms.txt file. An endpoint is also accessible (`/api/seo/llms`) for your **frontend** to fetch the content of this field and to create the llms.txt in order to have an AI-readable content for your website. It offers a practical solution to help AI systems better understand and utilize web content, particularly for technical documentation and APIs.
